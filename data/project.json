The eleven digitized videos, provided to the public by The Ransom Center, show Adler teaching at the Stella Adler Studio of Acting between 1969 and 1980 as well as being interviewed by Bob Crane. These digitized videos are a small portion of over a thousand audiovisual items in the collection. We hope that these annotations and essays put in context these digitized audiovisual materials and serve as an entry point into research in the Stella Adler collection. The project was conceived by Zoe Bursztajn-Illingworth as part of the Initiative for Digital Humanities for students participating in Professor Tanya Clement’s Digital Humanities and Social Justice Archives class. We would like to thank Steve Wilson, Lauren Walker, and Eric Colleary at the Ransom Center and for their support of this project.","language":"en","slug":"annotating-adler","creator":"tanyaclement","authors":"Zoe Bursztajn-Illingworth, Dahee Lee, Bella Siu, and Joshua Sklar, and edited by Tanya
